# Unit Overview: Drama

Welcome to Unit II: Drama! In this unit, students will examine four films: *Moonlight, Mosquita y Mari, Carol* and *Pariah*.
While *Moonlight* and *Carol* were widely released and received many award nominations and wins, *Pariah* and *Mosquita y Mari* received less critical and popular attention and were made with smaller budgets; in fact, *Mosquita y Mari* was funded through an $82,000 Kickstarter project.

***Moonlight:***
Students will debate two scholars' perspectives on the film's treatment of queer Black masculinity, and read excerpts from E. Patrick Johnson's essay, "'Quare Studies," which challenges the implicit whiteness of queer theory. Readings to accompany *Moonlight* include:
  * Day 2: E. Patrick Johnson, "In The Quare Lightt of the Moon: Poverty, Sexuality, and Makeshift Masculinity in *Moonlight*"
  * Day 2: L. H. Stallings, "Am I A Faggot?"
  * Day 3: E. Patrick Johnson, "'Quare Studies"

***Mosquita y Mari***
Students will use Whitney Monaghan's essay to examine how this film disrupts typical "coming out"/"coming of age" narratives and prioritizes what is unsaid over what is spoken, and analyze the film alongside Juana Maria Rodríguez's examination of gestures and queer Latina femme sexualities. Readings to accompany *Mosquita y Mari* include:
* Day 2: Whitney Monaghan, "Not Just a Phase: Queer Girlhood and Coming of Age on Screen"
* Day 3: Juana Maria Rodríguez, Introduction to *Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings*

***Carol***
Students will use Victoria L. Smith's examination of how Todd Haynes constructs heterotopias in *Carol* through framing, color and other formal elements. Students will also examine *Carol* alongside Sara Ahmed's analysis of compulsory heterosexuality and queer affects that develop in response to heteronormativity. Readings to accompany *Carol* include:
* Day 2: Victoria L. Smith, "The Heterotopias of Todd Haynes: Creating Space for Same-Sex Desire in Carol"
* Day 3: Sara Ahmed, "Queer Feelings"

***Pariah***
Students will examine dueling perspectives on the narrative's development of Black motherhood in *Pariah*, and will apply Audre Lorde's framework of "the erotic as power" to *Pariah*. Readings to accompany *Pariah* include:
* Day 2: Heike Raphael-Hernandez, "'I am not running, I am choosing'": Black Feminist Empowerment and the Continuation of a Literary Tradition in Julie Dash's *Daughters of the Dust* and Dee Rees' *Pariah*
* Day 2: Shoniqua Roach, "Unpacking *Pariah*: Maternal Figuration, Erotic Articulation, and the Black Queer Liberation Plot"
* Day 3: Audre Lorde, "Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power"
