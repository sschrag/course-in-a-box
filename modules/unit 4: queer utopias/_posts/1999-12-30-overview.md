# Unit Overview: Queer Utopias

Welcome to Unit 4: Queer Utopias! In the first three units of this course, genre and form organized our study. In this final unit, rather than examining a genre, students will examine a few theoretical concepts -- queerness, utopia, and futurity -- across film, television, and music video. This unit is primarily grounded in excerpts from Jose Esteban Muñoz's book, *Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity.*  On the first page of Muñoz's book, which students will examine in the first day of this unit, Muñoz writes:

"The future is queerness' domain. Queerness is a structuring and educated mode of desiring that allows us to see and feel **beyond the quagmire of the present. The here and now is a prison house.** We must strive, in the face of the here and now's totalizing rendering of reality, to think and feel a *then and there*. Some will say that all we have are the pleasures of this moment, but we must never settle for that minimal transport; we must dream and enact new and better pleasures, **other ways of being in the world, and ultimately new worlds."**

In this unit, students will ask:
* Why is this here and now a "prison house" for LGBTQ people?
* How do LGBTQ people use the past and the future to create "other ways of being in the world" and "ultimately new worlds?"
* How do works of film, television, and music video convey that world-making?
* How does the framework of queer futurity intersect with Afrofuturism?
