**Film background/summary:** *United in Anger: A History of ACT UP* is a documentary directed by Jim Hubbard and produced by Hubbard and Sarah Schulman. The film chronicles the efforts of ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power), a grassroots activist network that used a variety of tactics to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and challenge discriminatory and harmful practices by the federal government, the Catholic church, the media, etc. The documentary primarily addresses ACT UP's New York chapter's work from 1987-1996. The film relies on archival footage from ACT UP's direct actions, as well as from interviews that Hubbard and Schulman filmed and archived on their website, the [The ACT UP Oral History Project](http://www.actuporalhistory.org/). All told, Schulman and Hubbard conducted 187 interviews with ACT UP members for this oral history project in order to preserve the legacy of this activist movement. Schulman and Hubbard also created a [website](unitedinanger.com) for the film, which has many helpful resources for additional reading.

Another film that covers some of the same ground as this film and makes use of the ACT UP Oral History Project and archival footage of ACT UP's direct actions is David France's 2012 film, *How to Survive a Plague.* This film is more well-known, but I thought it would be best to include a different perspective, since France also directed *The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson.* *United in Anger* and *How to Survive a Plague* are fascinating to compare; while they make use of much of the same footage, France's documentary is more narrowly focused on actions targeting pharmaceutical developments and more prominently features the perspectives of white gay men; Hubbard's film represents a broader set of concerns that ACT UP raised and features interviews with more women and people of color. If you have time, you could extend this week's work by asking students to watch at least part of *How to Survive a Plague* (available on Netflix) and compare the different narratives and perspectives that these films present.
