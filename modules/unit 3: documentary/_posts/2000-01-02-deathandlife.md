**Film background and summary:** *The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson* is a 2017 documentary, directed by David France. It is France's second documentary; he also directed *How To Survive a Plague* (2012), which focuses on HIV/AIDS and the ACT UP movement in New York City in the 1980s and 1990s. *The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson* chronicles the story of Marsha P. Johnson, who was a prominent figure in the Stonewall rebellion, co-founded the group Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries in the 1970s with Sylvia Rivera, and was an LGBTQ advocate until her death in 1992. The film follows Victoria Cruz, an anti-violence advocate, as she investigates the circumstances of Johnson's death. *Happy Birthday, Marsha* is a 2018 short film created by Black trans artist Tourmaline and Sasha Wortzel. This week, we will be watching these two films together to address the ethics of storytelling and the different approaches of these two films to portraying Marsha P. Johnson. Students should watch *The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson* prior to Day 1's class, and *Happy Birthday, Marsha!* prior to day 2's class along with the assigned reading for that day. For more on the controversy in the making of these two films, you may want to read (and perhaps assign) this essay by Tourmaline in [Teen Vogue](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/reina-gossett-marsha-p-johnson-op-ed) or this article in [Slate](https://slate.com/human-interest/2017/10/marsha-p-johnson-netflix-doc-raises-questions-over-what-trans-led-storytelling-would-look-like.html).
