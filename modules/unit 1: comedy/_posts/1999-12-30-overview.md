# Unit Overview: Comedy

Welcome to Unit 1: Comedy! In this unit, students will examine four films: *But I'm A Cheerleader, Boy Meets Girl, Saving Face* and *Appropriate Behavior.*

***But I'm A Cheerleader***: Because this is the first week of the course, Day 1 includes the introduction of some course systems and materials we will use throughout this course. On Day 1, I included a teacher model for a student-led scene analysis presentation, so that you could begin asking students to do scene analysis presentations as early as week 2. If you plan to rearrange the sequence of this course, you may want to move some of these introductory materials to whatever you choose to be the first week. Brief YouTube clips are also included in this week's lessons to help familiarize students with some of the concepts that emerge in *But I'm A Cheerleader* and are relevant throughout the course, such as heteronormativity, sexual orientation, and gender identity.

In addition, students will learn some of the conventions of romantic comedy as a genre, examining how *But I'm A Cheerleader* utilizes or subverts those tropes. Students will also examine their first queer theory text of the course: brief excerpts from Jack Halberstam's book, *The Queer Art of Failure.* They will close-read the film's final scene to examine how it illustrate's Halberstam's argument regarding "queer failure" and its value.

Readings to accompany *But I'm A Cheerleader* include:
* Day 2: Tamar Jeffers McDonald, Introduction to *Romantic Comedy: Boy Meets Girl Meets Genre*
* Day 3: Jack Halberstam, *The Queer Art of Failure* (Excerpts)

***Boy Meets Girl***: Students will examine this film alongside excerpts from Julia Serano's book, *Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity.* Using Serano's text, students will consider some of the longstanding tropes and stereotypes in media depictions of transwomen, and explore whether and how *Boy Meets Girl* subverts those stereotypes. Students will also examine how the film depicts and critiques cisgender privilege. I have also included a "Trans 101" YouTube video to introduce key terminology related to gender identity.

Readings to accompany *Boy Meets Girl* include:
* Day 2: Julia Serano, *Whipping Girl,* Chapter 2: "Skirt Chasers: Why the Media Depicts the Trans Revolution in Lipstick and Heels"
* Day 3: Julia Serano, *Whipping Girl,* Chapter 8: Dismantling Cissexual Privilege

**Saving Face**: This week, we are examining two film studies texts on *Saving Face,* rather than a film studies and queer theory text, because unlike *But I'm A Cheerleader* and *Boy Meets Girl*, there has been a fair amount of scholarship on this film. Both of the texts we will be examining address the relationship between Wil and Ma, and their "shared marginality" (Wong 330) due to their non-normative sexualities.

Readings to accompany *Saving Face* include:
* Day 2: Alvin Ka Hin Wong, “From the Transnational to the Sinophone: Lesbian Representations in Chinese-Language Films"
* Day 3: Qijun Han, “Diasporic Chinese Family Drama Through A Transnational Lens: *The Wedding Banquet* and *Saving Face.*”

**Appropriate Behavior**
