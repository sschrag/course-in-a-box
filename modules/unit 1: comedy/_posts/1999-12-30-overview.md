# Unit Overview: Comedy

Welcome to Unit 1: Comedy! In this unit, students will examine four films: *But I'm A Cheerleader, Boy Meets Girl, Saving Face* and *Appropriate Behavior.*

***But I'm A Cheerleader***

Because this is the first week of the course, Day 1 includes the introduction of some course systems and materials we will use throughout this course. On Day 1, I included a teacher model for a student-led scene analysis presentation, so that you could begin asking students to do scene analysis presentations as early as week 2. If you plan to rearrange the sequence of this course, you may want to move some of these introductory materials to whatever you choose to be the first week. Brief YouTube clips are also included in this week's lessons to help familiarize students with some of the concepts that emerge in *But I'm A Cheerleader* and are relevant throughout the course, such as heteronormativity, sexual orientation, and gender identity.

In addition, students will learn some of the conventions of romantic comedy as a genre, examining how *But I'm A Cheerleader* utilizes or subverts those tropes. Students will also examine their first queer theory text of the course: brief excerpts from Jack Halberstam's book, *The Queer Art of Failure.* They will close-read the film's final scene to examine how it illustrate's Halberstam's argument regarding "queer failure" and its value.

Readings to accompany *But I'm A Cheerleader* include:
* Day 2: Tamar Jeffers McDonald, Introduction to *Romantic Comedy: Boy Meets Girl Meets Genre*
* Day 3: Jack Halberstam, *The Queer Art of Failure* (Excerpts)
