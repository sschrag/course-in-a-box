**Film background:** *Appropriate Behavior* was the directorial debut of Desiree Akhavan, who wrote, directed, and starred in the film. She went on to direct the 2018 film *The Miseducation of Cameron Post,* based on the novel by Emily Danforth. Akhavan wrote *Appropriate Behavior* for her graduate thesis at New York University. While there are elements of Shirin's character that mirror some of her experiences, such as her Iranian-American background and her bisexuality, she has stated that the film is not autobiographical.

**Plot summary:** *Appropriate Behavior* takes place in Brooklyn, NY, and follows Shirin (Desiree Akhavan), as she processes a recent break-up with her ex-girlfriend, Maxine (Rebecca Henderson). The film has many flashbacks that examine the trajectory of Shirin and Maxine's relationship.
