**Film background:** Mosquita y Mari is a 2012 coming-of-age drama about two Latina teenage girls in Huntington Park, California (near Los Angeles). The film was written and directed by Aurora Guerrero, a queer-identified Chicana writer and director from San Francisco.

**Plot summary:** (from Wikipedia): When Yolanda Olveros meets her new neighbor Mari Rodriguez, all they see in each other are their differences. An only child, sheltered Yolanda's sole concern is fulfilling her parents' dream of a college-bound future. With her father's recent death, street-wise Mari, the elder of two, carries the weight of her sister as their mother works to keep them above water. But despite their contrasting realities, Yolanda and Mari are soon brought together when Mari is threatened with expulsion after saving Yolanda from an incident at school. The girls forge a friendship that soon proves more complex than anticipated when the girls unexpectedly experience a sexually charged moment between them. As Yolanda and Mari's feelings reach new depths, their inability to put words to their emotions leads to a web of unspoken jealousy. Mari ends up meeting with a boy from the street for money in their study hideaway. The two girls spend time apart. The final scene shows them looking at each other from opposing sides of the street, with gentle smiles.

**Content warnings:** The film includes references to off-screen sex work, as well as occasional alcohol and marijuana use.
